Write a computer program in C++ (CPP 17)  programming language to compose a least square approximation for a given data set.

Input format:

  - the length m of data set
  - m lines with experimental data ti *space* bi
  - the degree of the approximation polynomial n.

Output format:

  - the matrix A itself right after the line <<A:>>
  - the matrix  ATA right after the line <<A_T*A:>>
  - the matrix  (ATA)âˆ’1 after the line <<(A_T*A)^-1:>>
  - the matrix  ATb after the line <<A_T*b:>>
  - the answer itself after the line <<x~:>>
